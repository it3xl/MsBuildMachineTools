# MsBuildTools
### Workarounds and tools for MSBuild and DevEnv working under build machines

This project is under active development and not ready yet.

**MsBuildTools** supports Visula Studio 2019, 2017.  
 _ For earlier Visual Studio versions use my CMD project - [MSBuild-DevEnv-Build-Server-Workarounds](https://github.com/it3xl/MSBuild-DevEnv-Build-Server-Workarounds)

## Purpose of this project

I expect you came here from StackOverflow.com

MSBuild and DevEnv have bugs that arise under non-interactive sessions.  
I.e. if you use MSBuild and DevEnv with a buld-machine.  
I collected here useful workarouns.

Also I added some scripts/tools that consider to be useful for you.
